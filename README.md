Minishell
Minishell is an intermediate project at 42 that involves creating a simple shell, similar to the Unix shell, from scratch. The goal is to develop a basic command-line interpreter that can execute commands, manage processes, and handle input/output redirection.

Key features of the Minishell project include:

Prompt Display: Displaying a command prompt where users can type commands.
Command Parsing: Reading and parsing user input to identify commands and arguments.
Execution of Commands: Implementing built-in commands (like cd, echo, exit, etc.) and handling the execution of external programs using fork() and execve().
Pipes and Redirection: Implementing support for pipelines (|), input (<), and output (>) redirections, allowing the combination of multiple commands and redirection of data streams.
Signal Handling: Managing signals to handle user interruptions (like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, etc.) and ensuring the shell remains responsive.
Environment Variables: Managing environment variables and allowing their use and modification within the shell.
The Minishell project challenges students to delve deep into the Unix process model, inter-process communication, and system calls. By building their own shell, students gain a thorough understanding of how command-line interfaces work, how to manage processes and resources efficiently, and how to handle various edge cases in a real-world application. This project is an excellent exercise in systems programming and provides a strong foundation for understanding more complex operating system concepts.
